		<h2>Interactive and UX Design</h2>
        <p>Interactive Design and UX Design come hand in hand. UX Design stands for User Research Design. This type of design focuses on the user and their wants and needs in order to achieve a goal as efficiently as possible with no frustrations. Interactive Design is the actual production and building of the product, app or website for the user. <br> <br>
        In class we often code websites from scratch in order to get a better feel for how things are put together and to strengthen our skills as front end coders and visual designers. Below are downloadable files of previous projects I have conducted user research on and websites I built in class with the intention of strengthening specific skills. Hope you enjoy!
